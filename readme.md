Small Typescript app showcasing Composition & Inheritance using Typescript.

to run:
npm install
npm start

Currently set up to read some matches from a dataReader - in this case, a CsvReader.
The read data will be used by a Summary component to provide a (very simple) analysis and report output.

The purpose of this app was to try out Typescript functionality such as:
Type Annotations
Enums
Type Assertions
Tuples
Generics
Interfaces
Static methods
